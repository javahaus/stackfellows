# User Stories

## MVP Orientated

- Personal Login: As a user I want to be able to login with my username and password and easily access the questions I have asked, and ones I have answered.
- Code For Review: As a user I want a text box where I can copy paste my code that I am relating to the question/post.
- Post Feature: As a user I would like to be able to ask a coding question where other students/instructors/tas/alumni can provide a detailed answer.
- Upvote: As a user I want to be able to upvote posts and answers.
- Browse Other Posts: As a user I would like to browse through questions asked by others so that I may be able to help a fellow coder.

### Personal Login

User Story: As a user I want to be able to login with my username and password and easily access the questions I have asked, and ones I have answered.

Feature Tasks:

- New user can self-register with their own unique username.
- New user can self-register with their own password.
- Users can log in to the webapp.
- Users can view a list of questions (posts) they made themselves in the past.
- Users can view a list of answers (posts) they made themselves in the past.

Acceptance Tests:

[ ] Registration allows unique usernames.
[ ] Registration allows user to pick their own password.
[ ] Users are allowed to log in using their own username and password after registration.
[ ] A page (presumably the "user profile" page?) will display any/all posts made by currently logged in user.

Note: We have not determined a means to differentiate between Question Post and Answer Post, which may end up being a stretch goal.
