## User Stories

We have a large list of stories stored in our Trello Board [here](https://trello.com/b/vgEW8ZaR/javahaus-project)

As a user, I would like to be able to login with my username and password and easily ask or answer questions
and access the questions I have asked, and the ones I have answered.  The username and password need to be stored
and protected from being visible.

As a Code Fellows student, I would like to be able to ask coding questions where other students/instructors/ta's/alumni
can provide help, suggestions, hint, or detailed answers. I should also be able to ask follow-up questions on individual 
answers.

As a user, I would like to browse through questions asked by others so that I may be able to help a fellow coder. in 
browsing I can also try to find answers to questions that I may have.

As a user, I want to be able to copy and paste my related code into a text box to post along with the question that 
I am asking. This will allow me to post the exact code I have, without mistyping or misspelling by retyping.

As a user I want the ability to upvote questions that haven't been sufficiently answered and need more visibility. I 
also want to be able to upvote answers that have helped me or contain the answer I believe to be correct and/or the best
way to go about answering the question.
