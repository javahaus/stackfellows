## User Stories

We have a large list of stories stored in our Trello Board [here](https://trello.com/b/vgEW8ZaR/javahaus-project) below
is a sampling of those we have implemented:

As a user, I would like to be able to log in with my username and password and easily ask or answer questions
and access the questions I have asked, and the ones I have answered.  The username and password need to be stored
and protected from being visible.

As a Code Fellows student, I would like to be able to ask coding questions where other students, instructors, teaching
assistance and alumni could provide help, suggestions, hints, or detailed answers. I should also be able to ask 
follow-up questions on individual posts from other users.

As a user, I would like to browse through questions asked by others so that I may be able to help a fellow coder. I can 
also try to find answers to a question previously asked.

As a user, I want to be able to copy and paste my related code into a text box to post along with the question that 
I am asking. This will allow me to post the exact code I have (neither auto correct nor intellisense are an MVP goal).

As a user I want the ability to upvote questions that haven't been sufficiently answered and need more visibility. I 
also want to be able to upvote answers that have helped me or contain the answer I believe to be correct and/or the best
way to go about answering the question.
